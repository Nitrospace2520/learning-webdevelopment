# JAVASCRIPT from `Namaste JavaScript`

## Execution Context:

- It consists of two parts `memory` and `code`
- `memory`:
  - Here all the variables, functions are store as `key:value` pair
- `code`:
  - Here all the further exection contexts are created from blocks, loops, functions etc.

## Call Stack:

- It is also known as `Execution Context Stack` or `Program Stack` or `Control Stack` or `Runtime Stack` or `Machine Stack`.

## Hoisting:

- Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase.
- This means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.
- `var` is hoisted but `let` and `const` are not hoisted.
